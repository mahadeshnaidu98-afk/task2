# task2
You are developing a simple grade management system for a school. The system needs to determine the grade of a student based on their score in a test. The grading system follows these rules:
score =int(input("enter the score:"))
if score>=90:
   print("the grade is a")
elif (score<=89 and score>=80):
    print("the grade is b")
elif(score <=79 and score >=70):
    print("the grade c")
elif(score <=69 and score >=60):
     print("the grade d")
else:
    print("the grade is f")
